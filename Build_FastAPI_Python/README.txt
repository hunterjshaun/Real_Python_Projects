Creating APIs, or application programming interfaces, is an important part of making your software accessible to a broad range of users. In this tutorial, you will learn the main concepts of FastAPI and how to use it to quickly create web APIs that implement best practices by default.

By the end of it, you will be able to start creating production-ready web APIs, and you will have the understanding needed to go deeper and learn more for your specific use cases.

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to:

Use path parameters to get a unique URL path per item
Receive JSON data in your requests using pydantic
Use API best practices, including validation, serialization, and documentation
Continue learning about FastAPI for your use cases
This tutorial is written by the author of FastAPI. It contains a careful selection of fragments from the official documentation, avoiding getting lost in technical details while helping you get up to speed as fast as possible.

To get the most out of this tutorial, it would be helpful for you to know the basics of what HTTP is and how it works, what JSON is, and Python type hints. You will also benefit from using a virtual environment, as is the case for any Python project.

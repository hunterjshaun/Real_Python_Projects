Python supports the object-oriented programming paradigm through classes. They provide an elegant way to define reusable pieces of code that encapsulate data and behavior in a single entity. With classes, you can quickly and intuitively model real-world objects and solve complex problems.

If you’re new to classes, need to refresh your knowledge, or want to dive deeper into them, then this tutorial is for you!

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:

Define Python classes with the class keyword
Add state to your classes with class and instance attributes
Provide behavior to your classes with methods
Use inheritance to build hierarchies of classes
Provide interfaces with abstract classes
